Last updated 3 March 2019

M. Emin Oner is committed to the protection of your privacy. Any collected data will only ever be used in accordance with this policy. This policy will also let you know about what information is collected by our third-party service providers, and link to how you can find out about how they use it. 

This policy applies to all versions of the Super Mega Space Game and its associated websites or other applications ("Games"). 

By playing Corona: Stay At Home you are consenting to the collection of data as outlined in this privacy policy. You also accept that this privacy policy can be updated from time to time for any reason, with the latest date of changes published at the top of this page.


Collection of Data

Sensitive Data: Corona: Stay At Home does not collect sensitive information about you. 

Personally identifiable Data: Our Games collect certain non-sensitive, data as outlined in this privacy policy. Some of this information is automatically gathered, and could be considered personally identifiable in certain circumstances, however it will generally always be anonymised prior to being viewed by M. Emin Oner, and never sold or shared. 

Personally identifiable data will only otherwise be actively collected by M. Emin Oner in very specific circumstances, such as if you contact us directly. 


Why Collect Data?

Player Feedback and Support: 
If you contact us with a comment or query, M. Emin Oner will keep a copy of any personal information you provide. This is so that we can respond to your comments and questions as a part of our commitment to providing you with player support. If you contact us directly for any reason, we also keep a copy of that correspondence. 


Advertising and Analytics: 
Advertising: When we offer our Games as free-to-play, we still require the game to generate income to help fund development costs and efforts to make the best game possible. Advertising is one way we can help cover our costs, and in order to implement relevant advertising a certain amount of information may be collected by each third-party ad network that operates within our Games. That information may be considered personally identifiable, or it could be considered personally identifiable in certain circumstances. This information is only ever used for our legitimate business interests and will never be sold or shared by us. 

Nevertheless, the data is provided to us by third parties. While we use all reasonable commercial endeavours to ensure that they adhere to any applicable laws, we encourage you to familiarise yourself with their data policies. 

Analytics: Information collected about our Game usage and about your device and location, allows us to better integrate updates, find potential device specific problems and bugs, explore localisation opportunities and make better Games that are tailored to our user's needs.


How Do we Use Data We Collect

Data collected for Advertising 
Because many M. Emin Oner Games are free-to-play, we periodically display in-game advertising by third parties to generate revenue. In order to display relevant advertising (also known as "interest based advertising") and measure performance of advertising campaigns we have implemented several ad-networks within the game which may collect and transfer non-sensitive device information such as:
* The advertisement you have viewed and if you have engaged with it;
* Device make and manufacturer;
* Operating System;
* Generic geographic location, such as the city you are located in;
* Carrier;
* Language settings;
* IP Address;
* Android Advertising identifier or Apple Identifier for Advertisers.


Data collected for Analytics 

We have implemented Analytics tools to help us understand how our Games are being used in order to help us improve our Games and plan for future game releases. For example we use GameAnalytics to keep track of how many players are engaging with our Games, player progress, any in-app purchases, as well as device type, operating system, language settings, play session lengths and broad geographic information like your country and city.


Age Limits

Corona: Stay At Home is designed for people who are at least 13 years of age. In playing our Games, you represent that you are aged 13 or older. If you are a guardian or parent who is concerned that we may have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us, and we will permanently delete any information we have under our control.
